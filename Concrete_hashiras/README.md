# Yin-Yang Coffee Experience ☕⚪⚫  
### Team: Concrete Hashiras  
### Project for 8-Bit Prompt Hackathon

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Yin-Yang Coffee Experience: Pixel Grind** is a unique 8-bit themed coffee website inspired by the Yin–Yang concept.  
This website is designed as the digital launch page for a newly opened café in town that serves dual-themed coffee styles:

- **Yin Path** → Soft, light, acidic, smooth coffee  
- **Yang Path** → Bold, intense, bitter, dark roast coffee  

The entire website blends the five required prompt words into an interactive user experience:

- **Roast** – Two roast levels: *Yin (light)* and *Yang (intense)*  
- **Time** – Animations, brewing timers, and a gaming stopwatch  
- **Connect** – Interactive sections connecting users with coffee choices  
- **Gravity** – Falling coffee beans & retro canvas animations  
- **Yin-Yang** – The core theme of the entire café and UI

## 🎮 Fun Gaming Experience
We added a **mini-game** inside the website to make the experience more engaging:

- Players race against **time**  
- The **fastest timing** gets a **discount coupon**  
- Canvas-based retro graphics  
- Adds a playful, gamified experience for the café visitors  

This encourages users to return & improves customer engagement.

## ☕ Dual Roast Philosophy
To make “Roast” meaningful, the website explains:

### **1️⃣ Yin Roast – Soft & Soothing**
- Light roasting  
- Soft flavors  
- Mild acidity  
- Perfect for beginners and delicate palates  

### **2️⃣ Yang Roast – Intense & Bold**
- Dark roasting  
- Deep flavors  
- Strong bitterness  
- Ideal for strong-coffee lovers  

This duality represents the balance of Yin-Yang in coffee.
